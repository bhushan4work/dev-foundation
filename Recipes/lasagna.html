    <p>Here's how to make a yummy lasagna taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/lasagna/">RecipeTinEats</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>350g/ 12 oz fresh lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (tightly packed) mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Finely chopped basil or parsley</li>
       
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to follow:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pork addition</strong>– Some traditional versions use a combination of pork and beef because pork is a more tender meat while beef provides the beefy flavour. To do this, use 250g/8oz pork and 750g/1.5lb beef. I do not (usually) do this simply because I feel like the sauce is so beautifully rich anyway (especially with the cheese sauce).</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>add this only if you think your sauce has a tinge of sour which can happen because not all canned tomatoes are created equal (economical tend to be more sour).</li>
        <li><strong>Cheese for sauce</strong>Use any eating cheese that melts like cheddar, colby, Monterey jack, gruyere. SHRED YOUR OWN for silky smooth sauce, packet shredded contains anti-caking agents which can make your sauce grainy. Australia: I steer clear of tasty cheese because some brands don’t melt nicely into cheese sauce, some are oily and some go a big grainy. </li>
        <li><strong>SHEET PLACEMENT</strong>If you watch the video, you will see I place the sheets in one direction for one layer, then the next time I place them 90 degrees the other way. This just helps the sheets stay in place a bit better when cutting – but it’s not a big deal!</li>
        <li><strong>Authenticity note: </strong>There is no single version of Lasagna in Italy though one might consider very traditional ones to be made with pancetta and milk and with no tomato paste, bouillon cubes or Worcestershire sauce and often made with white rather than red wine. Quite different to mine</li>
        <li><strong>MAKE AHEAD:</strong> Lasagna is brilliant for making and and freezing. Cover with foil and reheat in the oven at 180C or microwave it (this is my preferred because I feel like it keeps it more moist). If frozen, defrost before heating. Keeps for 3 days in the fridge.</li>
