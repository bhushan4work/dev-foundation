    <p>Here's how to make a yummy cookie taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/biscoff-stuffed-cookies/">RecipeTinEats</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients you'll need:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>280g / 9.5 oz biscoff spread</li>
        <li>225g / 2 US sticks unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups plain flour / all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tsp cornflour/cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda / bi-carb</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cooking salt / kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp all spice powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ginger powder</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (tightly packed) brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup caster sugar / superfine super</li>
        <li>1 large egg </li>
        <li>1 yolk from a large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps to follow: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Biscoff spread</strong>– I prefer smooth for stuffing but crunchy spread fine too. Find it in the spreads aisle. </li>
        <li><strong>Measuring 225g butter</strong>without scales – don’t guesstimate using packet markings!! Melt butter and measure 235ml using a jug (or 1 cup then remove 1 tablespoon), THEN brown the butter (once browned, butter is 180 – 190g). And yes, it’s 235ml, not 225ml (1g butter = 1.043173 ml).</li>
        <li><strong>Measuring flour</strong>– Scales best (and efficient). Cups – spoon flour into cups then level surface. Do not dunk cup measure into flour tub or bag (flour settles = 2 cups will be more than 300g = your cookies will puff more). *I am not usually this pedantic, only when a recipe is more sensitive than usual*</li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda </strong>– unlike the CCC, you can sub with baking powder. Use 1 1/2 teaspoons extra. Cookie will puff up more but is still very good.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>– I played with the mix and this is the balance I like the best, though even if I only had cinnamon I would still make them.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooled browned butter</strong>– Cool enough so it won’t melt the sugar or melt the choc chips, but not so cold the edges solidify (if it does, re-melt and cool again).</li>
        <li><strong>Smaller cookies</strong>Feel free to make smaller ones using smaller blobs of Biscoff, but larger cookies = longer bake = more assertive crispier edges.
        <li><strong>Fridge chilling</strong>enhances the cookie flavour, colour, texture and shelf life in a way you can’t cheat with any ingredient or shortcut. They are a 12/10 with recommended 12 – 24 hr chilling, 8.9/10 with 2 hour chilling! Up to 48 hours is just as great but doesn’t improve it further. Beyond 48 hours the surface of the dough balls can dry out a bit so I recommend freezing instead (after 12 hours). See storage below for freezing and baking from frozen.</li>
        <li><strong>Oven temp </strong> is only 10°C different here for fan v conventional. Also slightly higher than the CCC baking temp – to set the dough a bit faster to seal the Biscoff in. See FAQ.</li>
        <li><strong> Decorate choc chips</strong>– lightly press in to the surface or just rest on surface (chocolate will melt and adhere).</li>
        <li><strong>Storage </strong>– exceptional shelf life (for the 12 hours fridge chill version), edges stay crispy, inside stays moist and fudgy, doesn’t dry out and become crumbly. Excellent for 3 days, still near excellent on day 4, still great days 5 and 6. Store in an airtight container in the pantry.</li>
